              THIS is part of one of my projects of my Harvard career! On this occasion they have given us the challenge
              of making one of our first web pages; an autobiography! But, without feeling entirely satisfied, I decided
              to go a little bit further, in order to turn it into part of my own portfolio! Like a kind of CV, but with

              problem-solving skills needed to navigate any challenges that may arise. I am highly organized and able to
              manage my time effectively, ensuring that all tasks are completed efficiently and to the highest standard.
              My interpersonal skills allows me to build strong working relationships with my team and stakeholders.

              Bill Gates, Larry Page, Linus Torvalds... Those people are great references for me, and helped me to reach
              where I'm actually are. People like them are the reason why I always wake up in the morning, make me some
              nice breakfast, and... just type. Trying always to perform, to push myself, to learn something new... and
              with that, at the end of the day, be able to create. To contribute. And to make something that, hopefully,
              one day, changes the world to better. Hopefully one day my code reaches and helps to the people who more
              need it.

              achieving my goals. I believe that hard work and determination are the keys to success, and I consistently

              I really love to work on a team, because that's where you learn a lot. When you're alone, and you do
              everything by yourself aligned by your own perspective, not only you will be overloaded by
              responsibilities, but also and most importantly I think, it's that you won't have anyone to question your
              thoughts and how you implement them. We're all humans and make mistakes, and we can learn from them, but
              the problem is that we don't always realize that we make mistakes. In this world we need each other.
              <b>Because the teamwork makes the dream work.</b>

              I always try to perform myself and refine my personality, in order to become a better person in every
              aspect of my life. When things are not going as well as I would like, often I try to figure it out by
              myself what I'm doing wrong, and what can I do about it. If I can't handle it by myself, I ask for help on
              those that I trust, and that I know that they can give me a hand. And if someone is bothered by something
              that I've done or whatever,

              I am a highly rational and analytical thinker, with a natural tendency to approach problems and challenges

              These technologies (except for SASS), are the heart contained in each webpage that you see today. These
              are the pillars that regulates a vast part of the digital revolution in which we live today, so
              understanding how, when, why, and where to use them, it's crucial to provide to the clients an outstanding
              experience.

              With React, I'm capable of creating sublime SPA's and highly responsive web applications. The CSR type of
              render changes radically how you should develop your webpage compared to the traditional SSR approach.
              Thanks to my intensive study, professional teachers who stayed with me through the whole process, and
              investigation of how a CSR framework works and how it differs from the traditional approach, I'm able to
              debug, find, and mitigate all kinds of bugs that could be presented in a complex application.

              Each type of render for a web application has it upsides and downsides, and it's up to us the developers
              who creates the architecture to choose the one who fits the best the needs of our application, but NextJS
              introduced itself to the market with a whole new idea: Why not mix both types of render, in order to get
              the best from both worlds? And that's where NextJS kicks in. With a profound understanding and experience
              with SSR and CSR, with NextJS I've been able to mix both of them to create multiple web apps which its
              performance goes beyond than imagination.

              TypeScript is a powerful programming language that adds optional static typing and other advanced features
              to JavaScript. My expertise in TypeScript allows me to write more reliable, scalable, and maintainable
              code. The optional static typing catches type-related errors before runtime, saving time and effort in the
              debugging process. Additionally, TypeScript's advanced language features and type inference capabilities
              enable me to write code that is more concise and expressive. I am continually working to improve my skills
              in TypeScript and stay up-to-date with the latest language features and best practices.

              As I expanded my database skills beyond MySQL, I embraced the world of NoSQL with MongoDB. Choosing the
              right database for your application is vital, and I excel in seamlessly integrating both types to deliver
              maximum performance. I am well-versed in MongoDB's features, capabilities, and best practices, enabling me
              to design flexible and scalable database structures. From managing complex data relationships to storing
              unstructured data, MongoDB provides the perfect solution, and I have the proficiency to unleash its full
              potential. With extensive experience in optimizing queries, indexes, and schemas, I ensure your MongoDB
              deployments operate flawlessly, meeting and exceeding your application's needs.

              One of my strongest points while developing, are MySQL databases. And that's because MySQL was the first
              database technology that I've learned in my whole career, and I like it so much that I'm still using it!
              With MySQL I can ensure the reliability and functionality that the client needs while at the same time
              provide the simplicity and confidentiality through environment variables that the developers needs. Also,
              by creating a strong relational database architecture, the data becomes a lot more handy and readable to
              analyze and make some data science with it, create your own API, or even make your websites more dynamic!

              After sucessfully mastering how to properly use MySQL relational databases, I decided to take a step
              forward on my career and learn what are and how to use NoSQL databases. First of all, if you want to
              create a robust backend for your application, it's very important to understand which type of database
              best suits with your type of application. Whether your application fits better with one type or another, I
              can proficiently integrate both of them, guaranteeing the maximum performance that your application could
              ask (and deserves) for.

            <h2>Cypress & Cucumber course from Rahul Shetty Academy</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="paragraph margin-8">
            On the Cypress & Cucumber course I learned how to create unit tests to ensure that every component that
            you're testing works and behaves as expected. Also, I learned how to profesionally integrate E2E testings by
            testing a large number of web applications throughout the entire course and mix them with beauty and useful
            data-rich dashboards perfect to meet the business standards and requirements, and also talking about
            businesses, to extend even further the capability for non-technical personal to understand the overview
            performance of the tests and what each test is and represents on the page, I also can implement the Cucumber
            framework for a much improved TDD experience.

            The React Native course offered by Academind was a transformative experience in my web developer journey.
            Led by industry experts, the course provided a comprehensive understanding of React Native, empowering me to
            build native mobile applications. The course delved into the fundamental concepts of React Native, such as
            component-based architecture, JSX syntax, and the integration of native modules. Through hands-on projects
            and real-world examples, I gained practical experience in developing cross-platform mobile apps with React
            Native. The instructors at Academind fostered a supportive learning environment, providing clear
            explanations, practical demonstrations, and valuable insights into best practices. By completing the React
            Native course with Academind, I acquired the knowledge and skills necessary to confidently develop
            high-quality mobile applications using React Native.

            At BigBen English Institute, I studied English at an advanced level with skilled teachers. My coursework
            covered a range of topics including grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, and I developed a strong
            foundation in English language skills. In addition to the coursework, I had the opportunity to practice my
            English in real-world situations and received valuable guidance from my professors. I feel confident in my
            ability to communicate effectively in English thanks to the comprehensive curriculum and experienced
            instructors at BigBen English Institute. I am grateful for the opportunity to have studied with such skilled
            professionals and feel well-prepared to succeed in professional and personal endeavors that require strong
            English language skills.
